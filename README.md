# A growing bundle of dotfiles for doing bioinformatics and software development

That's right. It's yet another guy's dotfiles. Though I use lots of tools as a bioinformatician and data scientist, most of my configurations are for a core set of developer tools:

1. The Warp terminal emulator
2. The Helix text editor
3. The Zed text editor

If you do bioinformatics and data science and use these tools on Apple computers like me, read on!

### Setup on a new Apple machine

The point of this repository is to make setting up my development environment on different machines easy. To do so, I use [NixOS](https://nixos.org/), and ultimately [nix-darwin](https://github.com/LnL7/nix-darwin), to install packages from the Nix Package Repository, from Homebrew, and from the Mac App Store. Nix also handles downloading and deploying my dotfiles (which is to say this repo) with [dotter](https://github.com/SuperCuber/dotter). With these tools, we can take a very tedious series of manual installs, all of which tend toward bloat, and reduce them to just a few commands on a new machine.

First, assuming you've fired up a Terminal window on a new apple computer, we first need these dotfiles, which include a Nix flake:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nrminor/.dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
```

Next, we'll install NixOS:

```bash
sh <(curl -L https://nixos.org/nix/install)
```

And finally, we'll run the installer:

```bash
nix run nix-darwin  -- switch --flake ~/.dotfiles/.config/nix-darwin#starter
```

That's it! And to apply any changes to the OS that have been committed to this repo, run:

```bash
darwin-rebuild switch --flake ~/.config/nix-darwin
```

All said, this setup is very peculiar to me and should be expected to change frequently. Use at your own riskâ€”or, use as a starting point for your own NixOS journey!
